    <p id="tribute-info">Mister Rogers was the creater and composer of Mister Rogers Neighborhood, a children's television show that ran from the late 1960s to 2001. 

It spans 895 episodes and focuses on themes not commonly included in children's tv, including the topics of Death and Assassination, Divorce and Marriage. Happier topics included a small How to Make things section, where Mister Rogers showed viewers how items are created, like crayons and bagels. 

There was always a section of the show dedicated to the Neighborhood of Make-Believe where some of the these situations were talked about and played out for the viewer to understand. Mister Rogers never talked down to viewers and understood how important having a facet of education was for children and adults of all ages, which is how he ended up speaking to the United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications, winning the new PBS (Public Broadcasting Station) station $22 Million dollars in funding.

Mister Rogers was also a Presbyterian, and believed that he did not need to preach to get the morals and beliefs of his faith across. Many of the core beliefs and tenents of the show came from the larger Christian faith. </p>
